        <h1>About Me</h1>

        <p> My name is Jayden Shipley and I graduated <b>Magna Cum Laude</b> with a Bachelor of Science in Digital Cinema Production at Utah Valley University in 2023.

        <p>I work on films as the Cinematographer, as well as 1st and 2nd Camera Assistant. In addition to Cinematography, I enjoy working in the Art Department and I've worked on projects such as <i>The Book of Mormon Video Series</i>, <i>The Chosen</i>, <i>Stage Kids</i>, and <i>Jailbirds</i> in various positions.</p>

        <p> I also have a passion for photography, and I've enjoyed taking photos since I was in High School. I've recently taken up film photography as well. I am currently a certified Production Assistant with the Utah Film Commission. </p>

        <h2> A few films that inspire me and the work I want to create: </h2>
        <dl>
            <dt>Fantastic Mr. Fox</dt>
            <dd><em>Fantastic Mr. Fox</em> is a quirky, stop-motion animated film directed by Wes Anderson, based on Roald Dahl's classic children's book. I love how the story is told in the stop motion medium. It creates a kind of wonder that really helps to convey the meaning of the childrens classic. From a child to a young adult, I have always enjoyed the set decoration, character development, and cinematography that make this film what it is.</dd>
          
            <dt>Baby Driver</dt>
            <dd><em>Baby Driver</em> is a high-octane crime thriller from director Edgar Wright, where the title character, Baby, is a young getaway driver. Edgar Wright uses music to choreography the movement in this film. He is so deliberate with everything that he does down to the tiniest detail. I really enjoy his usage of music, and the fast pased, creative editing that is seen throuought this film. </dd>
          
            <dt>The Secret Life of Walter Mitty</dt>
            <dd><em>The Secret Life of Walter Mitty</em> tells the story of Walter, a mild-mannered photo editor who escapes his dull life by daydreaming about grand adventures. This film is my all time favorite. Along with a teriffic storyline, this film also presents beautiful imagery and silly yet realistic portrayals of everyday people.</dd>
